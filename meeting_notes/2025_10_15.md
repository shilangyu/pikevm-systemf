## Collected notes

### Lessons learned

- Trying to prove things about a definition can be extremely tedious. Sometimes it might be worth defining an inductive and proving it equivalent to some definition just to have the proofs be so much easier.

- Having `None` in `literal` is cool, but maybe unnecessary. It gives life to the optimization of rejecting a regex completely, but that could be a separate analysis on the regex. At the moment None can arise only with the CdEmpty character class.

- Leaving things not proven is a better way to progress. Proving small simple but very time consuming lemmas is wasting time and not progressing the theory. However, on the other hand I did leave a lemma unproven once, and realized only later that it was actually not a true lemma despite me relying on that lemma in other proofs.

## To discuss

- There is a `LazyPrefix.v`. Some proofs there might be very useful.

## Action items

Move onto proving equivalence of first_leaf on trees that are pruned if the string search does not find a match in this position of the haystack.
