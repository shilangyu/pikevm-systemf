## Collected notes

## To discuss

- Move `strs:StrSearch` to the `nextprefix` just like we did for the literal? Then running the anchored engine would not require this? -> Yes!
- Project title

## Action items

- Move `strs:StrSearch` to the optional of `nextprefix` in the PikeVM -> done
- If there is time, prove the "do prefix acc once" for the version of engines -> done
- Try to find a small reproduction of the issue with typeclass instances in proofs. Maybe this issue appears when we use #[refine]? -> done, issue was using `Qed` instead of `Defined`
