## Collected notes

## To discuss

- Benchmarks of the prefix acc vs non-prefix acc -> relate to the Rust benchmarks. Otherwise there is not much to evaluate

## Action items

- No opam install of our deps in Linden CI ✅
- Cherry pick changes that add `may_erase` ✅
  - Add non-det initialization of lazy-prefix piketree ✅
- Document the meta engine ✅
  - consider an optimization that detects anchored searches
- Rename the macro of the piketree nextt -> `lazy_` ✅
- Move `input_prefix` to where `strict_suffix` but specify that it is for induction purposes and `strict_suffix` is the canonical repr ✅
- Presentation next week:
  - 20/25 min
  - present general progress about optimizations
  - Outline:

    1. Motivation: let's verify real implementations
    1. Remind the project goal
    1. Talk about prefix acceleration and the implementation
       - Acceleration
       - Generation
       - Filtering
    1. Outline the proof for prefix acc
    1. Next steps: meta engine
