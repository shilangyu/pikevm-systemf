# Report

This is the report for my Master thesis, in [Typst](https://typst.app). It is written in a modular way allowing for easy adaptation to your own thesis.

It is heavily based on TUM's thesis template: <https://github.com/ls1intum/thesis-template-typst>.

## Building

Build the report with [`./build.sh`](./build.sh). Needed software:

- [Typst](https://typst.app/)
- [`jq`](https://jqlang.org/)
- [`opam`](https://opam.ocaml.org/)
- `make`

The first build might take a while, the report is built by reproducing data from source rather than copy pasting things into the report. On subsequent builds pass the `--skip-setup` flag to `build.sh`.

## Structure

Below you will find documentation explaining the general structure of the thesis and how to adopt it to your needs.

TODO: describe when I finish the report. Once we are sure this is how the report should look like.
