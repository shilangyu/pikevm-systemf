# Report

This is the report for my Master thesis, in [Typst](https://typst.app). It is written in a modular way allowing for easy adaptation to your own thesis.

It is heavily based on TUM's thesis template: <https://github.com/ls1intum/thesis-template-typst>.

## Building

Build the report with [`./build.sh`](./build.sh). Needed software:
