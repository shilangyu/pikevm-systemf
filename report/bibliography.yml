  abstract: "Modern regex languages have strayed far from well-understood traditional regular expressions: they include features that fundamentally transform the matching problem. In exchange for these features, modern regex engines at times suffer from exponential complexity blowups, a frequent source of denial-of-service vulnerabilities in JavaScript applications. Worse, regex semantics differ across languages, and the impact of these divergences on algorithmic design and worst-case matching complexity has seldom been investigated.This paper provides a novel perspective on JavaScript’s regex semantics by identifying a larger-than-previously-understood subset of the language that can be matched with linear time guarantees. In the process, we discover several cases where state-of-the-art algorithms were either wrong (semantically incorrect), inefficient (suffering from superlinear complexity) or excessively restrictive (assuming certain features could not be matched linearly). We introduce novel algorithms to restore correctness and linear complexity. We further advance the state-of-the-art in linear regex matching by presenting the first nonbacktracking algorithms for matching lookarounds in linear time: one supporting captureless lookbehinds in any regex language, and another leveraging a JavaScript property to support unrestricted lookaheads and lookbehinds. Finally, we describe new time and space complexity tradeoffs for regex engines. All of our algorithms are practical: we validated them in a prototype implementation, and some have also been merged in the V8 JavaScript implementation used in Chrome and Node.js."

  abstract: "We present an executable, proven-safe, faithful, and future-proof Coq mechanization of JavaScript regular expression (regex) matching, as specified by the latest published edition of ECMA-262 section 22.2. This is, to our knowledge, the first time that an industrial-strength regex language has been faithfully mechanized in an interactive theorem prover. We highlight interesting challenges that arose in the process (including issues of encoding, corner cases, and executability), and we document the steps that we took to ensure that the result is straightforwardly auditable and that our understanding of the specification aligns with existing implementations. We demonstrate the usability and versatility of the mechanization through a broad collection of analyses, case studies, and experiments: we prove that JavaScript regex matching always terminates and is safe (no assertion failures); we identify subtle corner cases that led to mistakes in previous publications; we verify an optimization extracted from a state-of-the-art regex engine; we show that some classic properties described in automata textbooks and used in derivatives-based matchers do not hold in JavaScript regexes; and we demonstrate that the cost of updating the mechanization to account for changes in the original specification is reasonably low. Our mechanization can be extracted to OCaml and JavaScript and linked with Unicode libraries to produce an executable regex engine that passes the relevant parts of the official Test262 conformance test suite."

  abstract: "Regular expressions (regexes) are a popular and powerful means of automatically manipulating text. Regexes are also an understudied denial of service vector (ReDoS). If a regex has super-linear worst-case complexity, an attacker may be able to trigger this complexity, exhausting the victim’s CPU resources and causing denial of service. Existing research has shown how to detect these superlinear regexes, and practitioners have identified super-linear regex anti-pattern heuristics that may lead to such complexity. In this paper, we empirically study three major aspects of ReDoS that have hitherto been unexplored: the incidence of super-linear regexes in practice, how they can be prevented, and how they can be repaired. In the ecosystems of two of the most popular programming languages — JavaScript and Python – we detected thousands of super-linear regexes affecting over 10,000 modules across diverse application domains. We also found that the conventional wisdom for super-linear regex anti-patterns has few false negatives but many false positives; these anti-patterns appear to be necessary, but not sufficient, signals of super-linear behavior. Finally, we found that when faced with a super-linear regex, developers favor revising it over truncating input or developing a custom parser, regardless of whether they had been shown examples of all three fix strategies. These findings motivate further research into ReDoS, since many modules are vulnerable to it and existing mechanisms to avoid it are insufficient. We believe that ReDoS vulnerabilities are a larger threat in practice than might have been guessed."

  abstract: "This paper explores the extent to which regular expressions (regexes) are portable across programming languages. Many languages offer similar regex syntaxes, and it would be natural to assume that regexes can be ported across language boundaries. But can regexes be copy/pasted across language boundaries while retaining their semantic and performance characteristics? In our survey of 158 professional software developers, most indicated that they re-use regexes across language boundaries and about half reported that they believe regexes are a universal language.We experimentally evaluated the riskiness of this practice using a novel regex corpus — 537,806 regexes from 193,524 projects written in JavaScript, Java, PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, Perl, and Rust. Using our polyglot regex corpus, we explored the hitherto-unstudied regex portability problems: logic errors due to semantic differences, and security vulnerabilities due to performance differences. We report that developers’ belief in a regex lingua franca is understandable but unfounded. Though most regexes compile across language boundaries, 15% exhibit semantic differences across languages and 10% exhibit performance differences across languages. We explained these differences using regex documentation, and further illuminate our findings by investigating regex engine implementations. Along the way we found bugs in the regex engines of JavaScript-V8, Python, Ruby, and Rust, and potential semantic and performance regex bugs in thousands of modules."
